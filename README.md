# Connect Four Game
This is a simple implementation of the Connect Four game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to Play
The game is played on a vertical board consisting of 6 rows and 7 columns. Two players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of your colored discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

## Code Overview
The index.html file contains the HTML structure of the game. It consists of a grid of cells, where the game is played, and some placeholders for showing the current player and the winner.

The style.css file contains the styling of the game, including the colors of the cells and the layout.

The script.js file contains the JavaScript code that implements the game logic. It initializes the board, keeps track of the current player, listens for clicks on the cells, and checks for a winner after each move.

## How to Run
To run the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The game will be displayed in the browser window, and you can start playing by clicking on the cells.
